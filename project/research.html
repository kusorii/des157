      <p>	Depression is a mood disorder that has been growing more common in people over the past few years, especially in young teenagers and college students. It is characterized by symptoms such as a change in sleeping habits, loss of appetite, lack of concentration, energy and interest in activities, and other negative emotions. Depression can be caused by many things, such as trauma, genetics, life circumstances (such as living conditions, relationships, etc.), brain changes, medical conditions, and drug or alcohol abuse. Some people struggle with the idea that self-harm is a way to temporarily lessen their depression and take off a small amount of burden they carry. </p>

      <p>There are a couple of ways to treat depression, but not all of them work for people. Psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and medications are some examples of treatments for those diagnosed with the disorder. Some people channel their feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression into making creative things. An example of this would be Faith-Ann Bishop in the TIME article titled “Teen Depression and Anxiety: Why the Kids Are Not Alright.” Faith-Ann showed signs of depression during 8th grade when she began to make small cuts on her skin near her ribs. She described the pain she felt after cutting herself was a relief of all her pent-up emotions. She would keep it a secret from her parents (who were supportive of her and would have helped her right away if they knew she was troubled) since she did not want to worry them.</p>

      <p>Three years after that, Faith-Ann told her parents about her depression. Her parents wished they knew earlier so that they could take their daughter to see a counselor. Having gotten help, Faith-Ann was getting better at coping with her depression and anxiety. In the article, she said that her way to cope with her disorder was to put her negative feelings into film-making and other arts. She was able to meet with a group of teenagers like her with depression, and they were able to support one another and share stories/feelings.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, people are becoming more aware of the fact that depression is a fairly common disorder. People try to help others in different ways to teach them how to cope with their anxiety and depression. One example of this is through the game called Celeste created by Matt Makes Games. The game is about a woman in her twenties who travels up Celeste Mountain. She runs into obstacles and faces enemies such as her negative thoughts taking on physical forms to haunt her. The article by Jordan Ramee titled “Celeste Is a Stunningly Effective Portrayal of Anxiety and Depression” states that “Celeste’s story and gameplay combine to help the player understand the constant struggle that comes with dealing with panic attacks and depression,” making the game a good platform on depression awareness and how people with the disorder struggle through their daily life. It helps to show what people are going through and it gives tips on how to slow yourself down when you’re feeling depressed or anxious. One key tip in the game is to take a breath and rest for example.

      <p>Depression is a constant reminder that people struggle from inner battles with themselves. Some people seek for help, while others tend to hide themselves to not worry others. There are many ways to try and cope with depression and putting all your emotions into art is one of them. For my final project, I want to take those negative feelings and have them be pushed towards creating new things.</p>
