      <p>For the paper prototype, I had to draw out my idea for the final project on paper. The prototype allowed me to figure out the layout of my game and how users would interact with it. After receviving feedback from my classmates, I learned to not be vague on showing the content of my game in prototyping. I heard that I needed to think more about character options and customization, terms to figure out the ending of my game (not using terms like "good" or "bad"), and fixing buttons/clicks for user comprehension.</p>
