          <h3>What is depression?</h3>
          <p class="info">Depression is a mood disorder in which the affected individual may have felings such as hopelessness, sadness, dejectedness, or other negative feelings that greatly affect the way the person thinks, feels, and acts on a daily basis. It makes one feel perhaps like a hindrance on others, that they aren’t loved or needed. It hinders their working habits, sleeping habits, and even eating habits.</p>
          <h3>What are some treatments for depression?</h3>
          <p class="info">Some treatments involve going to see a counselor or therapist in order to get their recomendations and help. Doctors can also prescribe medication (antidepresants) to treat the disorder, and these may take a few weeks to work, but they come with side effects. Other treatments have been to channel the negative energy into creative means in order to put attention elsewhere rather than dwelve in bad feelings. Some individuals also join groups where they discuss their problems and have others there who understand them and help them get through their problems.</p>
