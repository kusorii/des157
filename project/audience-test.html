      <p>Hello and thank you for helping me test out my visual novel, "There's Always A Better Day"! The game is best played in screens at size 1366 x 768, as any smaller or larger screen will mess up the formatting of the game.</p>
      <h1>Tasks</h1>
      <ol class="audience">
        <li>Navigate around the title page and find the "About" and "More Information" pages by hovering over each arrow and clicking them.</li>
        <li>*Important* Refresh the page and click "Start" to start the game, and proceed to play until you hit options to pick from. Pick an option and continue the game.</li>
        <li>Once you hit the current end of the story, refresh the page and restart the game, picking a different option than the previous one you chose.</li>
        <li>Play the game in fullscreen mode and exit out of the mode. (The option to play fullscreen is under construction, so there will be weird positioning)</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Questions</h1>

      <p>Hello and thank you for helping me test out my visual novel, "There's Always A Better Day"! You can read more about the project on the About page of the project itself. There are still many parts of the site under construction, and there are notifications
        in text where these parts are. Below this, you will find a list of tasks I would like you to try while playing the game and then a few questions regarding the project I would like you to answer afterwards. The game is best played in screens at
        size 1366 x 768 or larger, as any smaller screen will mess up the formatting of the game. You can get to the project by clicking <a href="proto3/index.html" target="_blank" id="proto">here</a>.</p>
