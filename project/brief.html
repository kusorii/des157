      <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
      <p>The topic I chose for this project was dealing with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and stress that comes from difficulties due to relationships, school, responsibilities, and other factors in life. As a person who grew up with many friends now suffering some form of mental illness, I want to shed more light into the community of how such emotions can grow, how one can deal with such negativity, and how to possibly start the long road to recovery for it. Although many people are becoming aware of mental illnesses, many do not know how to address affected people, and many who suffer from depression don’t know methods of coping with their feelings aside from hurting themselves (if they don’t seek help). I want to help spread tips and possible ways to cope with these feelings through a story of depression and anxiety in the form of a visual novel game.</p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The target audience for my project is virtually anyone who is interested in playing a game and learning about mental illnesses. The main audience I have in mind are those who are the most vulnerable to suffering from these illnesses: high school and college students, those in their late teens and early twenties. They are the most susceptible to facing many problems in life which can cause them to think negatively about things. Though this age range is my target audience, I want to make a game in which anyone (aside from young children who would not be able to read and understand the story) can pick up and understand quickly.</p>

      <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
      <p>I have two goals set in mind for the outcome of my project. The first goal is to spread more awareness to the public and especially to teenagers about the possible stress they might meet in the future or are currently dealing with, and how they can work to overcome such things. I would like to educate my audience and show them how it feels for a person who is dealing with depression and anxiety to live their life, and possible ways to live “alongside” such illnesses. This would all be done with the content of the game, in which the user helps their character make choices on how to deal with seemingly mundane events that happen every day. The second goal is to involve the users themselves in giving suggestions on how they deal or have seen close people they know deal with mental health issues. I plan to incorporate a section at the end of the game where users can type in their ideas and suggestions, which I will put into a separate list of possible methods of coping.</p>

      <h2>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel</h2>
      <p>For the overall look and feel of my project, I want to create a 2D style game that gives a more artistic/pixelated look rather than realistic. This is because I feel that my audience would be more interested in the realism of the story itself rather than the art or characters. It is a game where the user’s choices will affect the outcome of the character, and so the content and user interaction are more important than the (realistic) look of the characters and setting portrayed.</p>
      <p>At the moment, I’m still deciding on my color palette for the game. I don’t think I want to stick with a gray/black/white color scheme, since I believe it would feel to oppressive and negative to those who are trying to get through the game. A mix of cool and warm colors (dark shades) seem to work, as shown in my visual research with the mix of purple, pink, and blue works to keep the mood I want to incorporate into my project: not too cheery, but still having a splash of color in life.</p>
